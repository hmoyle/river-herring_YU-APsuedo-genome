Redoing river herring lane 1 analysis with the YU_APseudo genome from University of Illinois.
==============


## NOTES:
wednesday, April 16 2025
  - compare 1st chrom of alewife and shad with chromeister
  - check how much of the genome is in those 24 chroms/scaffs for reference

tuesday, April 22 2025
 - check out missingness in possible inversion region on alewife chrom 1 and shad chrom 9
 
 wednesday, April 23 2025
  - probably something we would want to contribute to the genome reference paper: can contribute to this paper, just in supplementary
  - need to fix pca for just alewife
  - fix admixture plots
  - haploplot should not change much
  - finalize new figures and drop them into the draft
  - get alewife turned into a manuscript by the summer/by the end of summer (carlos gone first half of june)
